                When traveling approximately five kilometers on the Kumbala to Badiadka road in the Kasaragod district, one is greeted on the right side by the grand entrance of the Shree Perne  Muchilot Bhagavathi Kshetra. This temple is home to Shree Muchilot Bhagavathi, the family deity of the Vaniya/Ganiga community, and is one of the prominent among the eighteen Muchilottu temples in Kerala. The temple, surrounded by sacred trees, is nestled in a serene, nature-rich area.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Kshetra is renowned for its peaceful and compassionate deity, Shree Perne Muchilot Bhagavathi, who is also revered as Annapoorneshwari, the goddess of food and nourishment. Known for fulfilling the wishes and desires of devotees, the temple's significance is a matter of personal experience. With a history that dates back centuries, this temple stands as a symbol of ideal practices and traditions, instilling pride with its commitment to simplicity, equality, fraternity, and social responsibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Kshetra, famous in the Kumbala region, underwent renovations, culminating in the Punarprathishta (re-consecration) and Brahmakalashotsava festival in March 2020. Although the temple had planned to host the Kaliyata alongside the Brahmakalashotsava, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a delay. After a gap of 20 years since the last Kaliyatam festival in 2004, the Pernna temple is once again ready to celebrate Kaliyatam from March 1st to 7th, 2024. It is the collective aspiration of the community to elevate this event to a grand celebration, drawing devotees from surrounding districts and even from other states.
                As the temple anticipates a large gathering of devotees, it remains a beacon of faith and hope. Devotees who visit the Shree Kshetra during this festive period, seeking blessings, wish for Shree Perne Muchilot Bhagavathi to bestow them with health, happiness, and prosperity. This is our collective prayer at the sacred feet of the Amma Bhagavathi.
