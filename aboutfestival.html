            <h2>Pooram Kali</h2>
            <p>
              Poorakkali is a traditional dance ritual performed by men during the nine-day Pooram festival in Bhagavathi temples. The Pooram festival begins with the Karthika asterism and concludes with the Pooram asterism of the month of Meenamasa according to the Malayalam calendar to honour Kamadeva, the god of love.                 
           </p>
           <p>
           The Poorakkali dance itself is performed by a troop of young men decked in lion costumes around a huge, multi-tiered, lit lamp, also known as a "Nilavilukku." The dance involves masculine movements and acrobatic, martial art steps. No singers or musicians accompany the dance; instead, the dancers themselves keep rhythm by singing, clapping and executing synchronised foot-thumping movements. The dancers usually observe a month of abstinence and undergo strenuous practice before the performance. Most of the songs sung are hymns from The Ramayana or The Bhagavata.
